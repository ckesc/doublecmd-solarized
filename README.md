===================

#Install
1. Close Double Commander!
2. Clone repo or open `colors.xml` on github and copy contents
3. Replace xml nodes of `Color` section in your `doublecmd.xml` file.

For Windows version you can find your `doublecmd.xml` file in `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\doublecmd\` 


#If you make your own color set
Double Commander stores colors in strange format. 

* I\`ve take RGB color like `#fdf6e3`
* swap colors to BGR `#e3f6fd`
* than convert to dec `14939901`

And this is value for xml
